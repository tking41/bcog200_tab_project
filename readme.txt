1. This final project will allow me to search and retrieve popular songs with guitars in them based on categories like difficulty level and tuning. I will use an existing data set that has all of the relevent song details and chord/tab information and the code will organize the data into a class. The idea is that you will be able to search for a list of songs based on your preferences of difficulty, key, tuning, etc, through the command line and make disovering songs much easier.

2. Three Functions
-A function that will take the dataset and create instances for each song and organizing all of the relevant details for each instance.
-A function that filters songs for any criteria and returns a list of the songs that fit those criterias.
-A function that allows you to search for the songs through the command line and prints the result in an easy-to-read format.

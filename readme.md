# BCOG 200 Guitar Songs Project

This final project will allow users to search and retrieve popular songs with guitars in them based on their difficulty level. I will use an existing data set that has all of the relevent song details and chord/tab information and the code will organize the data into a class. The idea is that you will be able to search for a list of songs based on your difficulty level through the command line and make disovering songs much easier.

**Methods Needed**
1. Loads the database in and puts each row into a list of tuples
2. Prints the instructions from a txt about how the project works on the command line
3. Asks the questions using the input() function
4. Formats the way the results will print

Please download the repository and when you're ready to begin, run "songs.py" on your command line.

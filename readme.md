# BCOG 200 Guitar Database Project

This final project will allow me to search and retrieve popular songs with guitars in them based on categories like difficulty level and tuning. I will use an existing data set that has all of the relevent song details and chord/tab information and the code will organize the data into a class. The idea is that you will be able to search for a list of songs based on your preferences of difficulty, key, tuning, etc, through the command line and make disovering songs much easier.

**Methods Needed**
1. Loads the database in and puts each row into a list of tuples
2. Loads in a separate csv file with the questions
3. Prints the instructions from a txt about how the project works on the command line
4. Asks the questions using the input() function
5. Formats the way the results will print

The user will be asked a series of questions about how they want to search the database. They can do a simple or advanced search and get back a list of recommended songs to practice.

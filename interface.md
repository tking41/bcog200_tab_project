# Testing the Program

The user will be able to test the functionality of the entire program by answering all of the questions on the command line. The questions could look something like this.

> What difficulty do you want to search for?  
> *Novice*   
> How many song recommendations would you like?  
> *5*   

Their results will print like this.

> Adele - Turning Tables, Key: Db, Capo: 1st fret, Tuning: E A D G B E  

There will be 5 different songs printed in this format.  

At the end of the printed section, the program will ask "Would you like more suggestions?" If the user says yes, it will print out more recommendations.
